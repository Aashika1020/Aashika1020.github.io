REPORT FOR SLIDESHOW
"The challenge was ensuring that the images are changed in the correct order and 
that the JavaScript functions worked properly. To overcome this challenge, I 
made sure the JavaScript conditions for the functions were logically correct. 
I approached this by creating two functions: one named 'movePrev' and the other
named 'moveNext.'

In the 'movePrev' function, which is called when the 'Prev' button is 
clicked, the 'current' variable, responsible for tracking the current image,
is decreased or decremented to display the previous image.
In the 'moveNext' function, called when the 'Next' button is clicked, 
increases the 'current' count, causing the next image to be displayed.

In cases where the 1st image is displayed and the user clicks 'Prev,' it goes
to the 8th image and displays that. Similarly, if the user clicks 'Next' while
on the 8th image, it returns to the 1st image. This is achieved 
through the 'if' and 'else if' conditions.

The 'DisplaySlide()' function stores all the images with the class name 
'mySlides' in the 'slides' variable. The 'for loop' then iterates through all 
the elements with the 'mySlides' class, setting their display style property 
to 'none' to hide the slides. Finally, the last line of the function displays 
the slide according to the 'current' variable by changing the display style 
property to "block".

In essence, I hide the slides using 'DisplaySlide()', and in the last line, 
I display the slide based on the value of the 'current' variable.

REPORT FOR LOGIN
For the login page, I initially created four input fields: one for the username,
another for the email, one for the password, and one to confirm the password.
I assigned relevant id's to each of these fields and ensured that they were 
paired with corresponding <span> elements, so that their respective error messages will
be displayed. I also assigned the error messages text to be in red color and 
if the input is correct, success messages text to be in green so the user has visuall

Next, I applied the provided CSS and made adjustments to the login page's
design. Moving on to JavaScript, I developed four functions: validateUsername(),
validateEmail(), validatePassword(), and validateConfirmPassword(). Each of
these functions is responsible for ensuring that the data entered into their
respective fields adheres to the correct format.

Finally, when the user clicks the login button, the validateForm() function
is called. It validates that all four fields have been correctly filled
in before allowing the form to be submitted.
